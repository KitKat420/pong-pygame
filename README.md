## History

Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972.

My version of Pong uses the library, Pygame, that allowed me to implement key controls; an automated ball and paddle; a scoring system and a win condition.
